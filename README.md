# EloWatch
An Overwatch ELO Tracker

## What does this do?
This little thing retrieves your (or anyone's) basic competitive overwatch info using lootbox.eu 's api. 
All you need is the person's BattleTag (Like TPineapples#1286) their region, and platform.
What you get is their Rank, Competitive Hours Played, Total Competitive Games Played, Comp. Games Won/Lost and their Comp. Win Percentage

## How do I install this
1. You first need the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/#) library. (pip install requests or follow the instructions on their site)
2. git clone this repo (Or atleast download EloWatch.py)
3. Run EloWatch.py in your desired terminal / interpreter
4. Enjoy!

## What else is to come?
I'm looking to add more features namely constant tracking/updating, visualizing data and maybe even making a live easily accessible version.
Additionally I am open to any ideas

Thanks for checking this repo out -T
